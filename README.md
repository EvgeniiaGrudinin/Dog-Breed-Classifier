# Dog-Breed-Classifier
Built an algorithm to identify canine breed given an image of a dog. If given image of a human, the algorithm identifies a resembling dog breed.
In this project I used a CNN model to dog breed recognition. It was my first full experience with GPU and Tensorflow.
Images in this repository intended for testing of our model.
