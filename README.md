# Dog-Breed-Classifier
Built an algorithm to identify canine breed given an image of a dog. If given image of a human, the algorithm identifies a resembling dog breed.
In this project I used a CNN model to dog breed recognition. It was my first full experience with GPU and Tensorflow.
Images in this repository intended for testing of our model.

1. Download the dog dataset. Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location path/to/dog-project/dogImages.

2. Download the human dataset. Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location path/to/dog-project/lfw. If you are using a Windows machine, you are encouraged to use 7zip to extract the folder.

3. Donwload the VGG-16 bottleneck features for the dog dataset. Place it in the repo, at location path/to/dog-project/bottleneck_features.
